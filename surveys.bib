	abstract = {The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence aims to find evidence of technosignatures, which can point toward the possible existence of technologically advanced extraterrestrial life. Radio signals similar to those engineered on Earth may be transmitted by other civilizations, motivating technosignature searches across the entire radio spectrum. In this endeavor, the low-frequency radio band has remained largely unexplored; with prior radio searches primarily above 1 GHz. In this survey at 110–190 MHz, observations of 1,631,198 targets from TESS and Gaia are reported. Observations took place simultaneously with two international stations (noninterferometric) of the Low Frequency Array in Ireland and Sweden. We can reject the presence of any Doppler drifting narrowband transmissions in the barycentric frame of reference, with equivalent isotropic radiated power of 1017 W, for 0.4 million (or 1.3 million) stellar systems at 110 (or 190) MHz. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of using multisite simultaneous observations for rejecting anthropogenic signals in the search for technosignatures.},

	abstract = {Radio searches for extraterrestrial intelligence have mainly targeted the discovery of narrowband continuous-wave beacons and artificially dispersed broadband bursts. Periodic pulse trains, in comparison to the above technosignature morphologies, offer an energetically efficient means of interstellar transmission. A rotating beacon at the Galactic Center (GC), in particular, would be highly advantageous for galaxy-wide communications. Here, we present blipss, a CPU-based open-source software that uses a fast folding algorithm (FFA) to uncover channel-wide periodic signals in radio dynamic spectra. Running blipss on 4.5 hr of 4–8 GHz data gathered with the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, we searched the central of our galaxy for kHz-wide signals with periods between 11 and 100 s and duty cycles (δ) between 10\% and 50\%. Our searches, to our knowledge, constitute the first FFA exploration for periodic alien technosignatures. We report a nondetection of channel-wide periodic signals in our data. Thus, we constrain the abundance of 4–8 GHz extraterrestrial transmitters of kHz-wide periodic pulsed signals to fewer than one in about 600,000 stars at the GC above a 7σ equivalent isotropic radiated power of ≈2 × 1018 W at δ ≃ 10\%. From an astrophysics standpoint, blipss, with its utilization of a per-channel FFA, can enable the discovery of signals with exotic radio frequency sweeps departing from the standard cold plasma dispersion law.},

	abstract = {The search for extraterrestrial intelligence at radio frequencies has largely been focused on continuous-wave narrowband signals. We demonstrate that broadband pulsed beacons are energetically efficient compared to narrowband beacons over longer operational timescales. Here, we report the first extensive survey searching for such broadband pulsed beacons toward 1883 stars as a part of the Breakthrough Listen's search for advanced intelligent life. We conducted 233 hr of deep observations across 4-8 GHz using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and searched for three different classes of signals with artificial (or negative) dispersion. We report a detailed search-leveraging a convolutional neural network classifier on high-performance GPUs-deployed for the very first time in a large-scale search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence. Due to the absence of any signal-of-interest from our survey, we place a constraint on the existence of broadband pulsed beacons in our solar neighborhood: ≲1 in 1000 stars have transmitter power densities ≳105 W Hz-1 repeating ≤500 s at these frequencies.},
